## Group Events

### Project Summary

For our JavaScript class group project, we are building an interactive website that explores a variety of unusual and fascinating careers. We each chose a unique job to research: ethical hacker, crime scene cleaner, bounty hunter, and one more still to be decided, and created individual tabs for each one. On our site, users can click through the tabs to learn more about each profession, including what the job involves, the skills needed, and other interesting facts. Through this project, we are applying our JavaScript and web development skills to design a creative and informative experience for our users.
