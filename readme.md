## Group Events

### Project Summary

For our JavaScript class group project, we are building an interactive website that explores a variety of unusual and fascinating careers. We each chose a unique job to research: ethical hacker, crime scene cleaner, bounty hunter, and one more still to be decided, and created individual tabs for each one. On our site, users can click through the tabs to learn more about each profession, including what the job involves, the skills needed, and other interesting facts. Through this project, we are applying our JavaScript and web development skills to design a creative and informative experience for our users.

### Key Takeaways

What have you learned or practiced during this semester that aided in the completion of your project? This year, I learned how to perform JavaScript and how to start coding using it. We did the basics, like learning to write simple code and make things work on a website. This really helped me out when doing my project.

### Core Webpages

Home: This page engaging summary of the site's purpose
About: explain the mission for each unusual jobs
Description: list and directory of unusual jobs. and include description of job,required skilled, average salary, pros and cons.

### Design Choices & Local Storage Design

We aim to have a unified, yet individualistic design to our website. We figure that due to the jobs being different, yet under the umbrella of Unique Jobs, the colors we use may be different, yet the layout and structure all share the same skeleton.

The data we are using will be gathered from several different sources and websites.
